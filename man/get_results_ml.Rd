\title{Process VCF File Using Machine Learning Model}
\usage{
get_results_ml(
  vcffile,
  outdir,
  sample_wt,
  sample_mut,
  GT_mut,
  mindp = 4,
  model_path = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcffile}{Path to the input VCF file (required)}

\item{outdir}{Output directory for results (required)}

\item{sample_wt}{Name of the wild-type sample in VCF (required)}

\item{sample_mut}{Name of the mutant sample in VCF (required)}

\item{GT_mut}{Genotype of mutant ("aa" only, currently supported)}

\item{model_path}{Optional path to custom model file (default: uses built-in model)}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. Outputs are saved to files in the specified directory.
}
\description{
This function analyzes VCF files using a pre-trained machine learning model to identify
candidate mutations. It handles data processing, feature engineering, model prediction,
and result visualization.
